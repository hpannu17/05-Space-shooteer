What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
I learned that the project has some run-time error. 

 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
I'm not sure if there is somthing as the game doesn't work
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
Try the video for Space shooter that was posted in extra resources to understand the structure and the working of the game
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
Nothing. There were enough comments.
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
I was confused why there was a runtime-error. There are usually syntax errors in a finished project.
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
It does.
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
Explain what was confusing since in this case the project has a run-time error. It helps in debugging for the peer review.

 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
I was confused a lot on this too. But hey you tried. That's all that matters. I looked up python arcade on google basically to learn. Try this link : http://arcade.academy/
